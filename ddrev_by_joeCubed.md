# Design doc review by Joe Cubed
___
## Good:
 - Super detailed project component list.
 - Timeline exists.
 - Nice seeing an example row for each table.
 - Diagrams are readable.
## Bad:
 - Timeline could be more detailed.
 - Not a very detailed description of what the project does at the top.
 - More arrows could be labeled in the component visualization map or in the site map for frontend.
 - Missing bullet for "Review Table" under Database Organization.
 - Site map for frontend could have more arrows going back from a page (ex: indicating where the user is taken after the Edit Past Review Page is submitted).
 - Tasks were not separated by team member.
